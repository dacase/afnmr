Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AFNMR package provides a useful method to estimate chemical shifts in
 biomolecules, density functional calculations on fragments.
 The program automatically creates the fragments from an input pdb file,
 prepares a model for environmental effects, then creates input files for
 various quantum chemistry programs.
 Once these quantum runs are complete, results can be extracted from their
 output files and collected into simple database files.

Ab initio chemical shifts can be computed using the automated fragment approach
 implemented in the AFNMR program and described in references [1], [2] and
 [6].
 The explicit solvent formalism described in reference [4] is planned for
 future versions, but is not included in the present version; however, the
 current code works well for snapshots taken from MD simulations that include
 explicit water molecules.
 Papers [7-12] are recent examples of applications of the afnmr method.
 Reference [13] is a review.

AFNMR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a program for carrying out automated fragment NMR (AFNMR) chemical
 shift prediction.
 In this approach, the chemical shielding tensors for 
\begin_inset Formula $^{1}$
\end_inset

H, 
\begin_inset Formula $^{13}$
\end_inset

C, 
\begin_inset Formula $^{15}$
\end_inset

N, and 
\begin_inset Formula $^{31}$
\end_inset

P are computed using an approached based on density functional theory.
 Because chemical shielding is a local property, the shielding tensors can
 be computed by including only a relatively small region around the nuclei
 of interest.
 AFNMR automates the procedure of breaking the input structure into fragments
 small enough to be treated with a high-level quantum mechanical theory
 (e.g., various density functionals).
 The shielding tensors are then computed using one of the supported QM packages,
 
\emph on
deMon
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Orca
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Q-Chem, 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
Gaussian
\emph default
.
 Users are directed to the relevant citations at the beginning of this manual
 for details regarding the fragmentation scheme for various systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solvent contributions to shielding tensors can be included by modeling the
 solvent implicitly (e.g., with the Poisson-Boltzmann or 3D-RISM formalisms).
 A procedure for including nearby water molecules explicitly in the QM calculati
on has been proposed to improve amide chemical shift predictions and is
 planned for future versions of AF-NMR.

General workflow 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:General-workflow"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing that AF-NMR does to the system is perform a local energy
 minimization using the Amber ff12SB force field.
 After that, the electrostatic potential (ESP) at the surface of the system
 is computed and surface point charges are fitted to reproduce this potential.
 AF-NMR then proceeds to break the system up into manageable fragments and
 writes input files for the requested QM package.
 It is then up to the user to run the QM calculations.
 While these calculations may take several hours to finish, each fragment
 can be done at the same time.
 The general workflow for AF-NMR is shown in

\begin_layout Standard
AF-NMR provides three ways to compute surface charges to model solvent effects.
 Only the second option is implemented in this release; see the 
\emph on
shifts
\emph default
 program (at 
\family typewriter
http://casegroup.rutgers.edu/shifts.html
\family default
) for information about options 1 and 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first uses the PBSA program included with AmberTools to compute the
 ESP at the surface of the system, setting the dielectric constant of the
 system interior to 1 and that of the solvent to 80.
 These surface charges are then used for every fragment while the atoms
 outside the fragment region are treated as point charges whose values are
 equal to the partial atomic charges assigned by the Amber force field.
 The PBSA program from AmberTools must be installed to use this approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The second approach also solves the PB equation, but instead uses a 3-dielectric
 model.
 In this case, the QM region is assigned a dielectric constant of 1, the
 interior of the system that is 
\emph on
outside
\emph default
 the QM region is assigned a dielectric constant of 4, and the region outside
 the system is assigned a dielectric constant of 80.
 With this approach, each fragment is assigned a separate set of surface
 charges at the surface of the QM region (as defined by the atom radii assigned
 by the force field).
 This approach helps to alleviate the overpolarization that occurs from
 the point charges of the atoms outside the QM region.
 However, it takes longer to compute the surface charges since a separate
 solution to the PB equation is required for each fragment; (however, this
 is still nowhere near the cost of the QM calculations themselves).
 This approach uses the 
\emph on
solinprot
\emph default
 program that is part of the 
\emph on
MEAD
\emph default
 package (see 
\family typewriter
http://stjuderesearch.org/site/lab/bashford
\family default
), and is included here as well.
 This is the default option, and the one that has been most extensively
 tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The final approach supported by AF-NMR to compute surface charges uses the
 3D-RISM formalism to compute the electrostatic potential.
 This approach uses a rigorous statistical mechanical approach to compute
 solvent distributions around solutes with arbitrary charge distributions.
 Like the first approach we described, it is applied to the entire system
 and a single set of point charges at the surface of the whole system are
 used to reproduce the ESP for every fragment.

\begin_layout Standard
The processing of structures is parallelized, and setting the environment
 variable 
\family typewriter
NCPUS
\family default
 to an integer will inform 
\emph on
multiafnmr.sh
\emph default
 to process the given number of structures simultaneously.
 This is primarily useful when using the -solinprot option, which takes
 longer to compute surface charges with.

Computing the shielding tensors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After running 
\emph on
afnmr
\emph default
 (or 
\emph on
multiafnmr.sh
\emph default
), you will have a handful of input files to the QM program you requestedâ€”one
 for each of the fragments (residues) in your system.
 You can either run the QM program directly at the command-line or you can
 run the command in a cluster using some type of batch scheduling system
 like torque, slurm, or Sun grid engine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We suggest that you pick the QM program you are most familiar with, which
 will help in debugging problems should they arise.
 If you've chosen 
\emph on
Gaussian
\emph default
, the input files will be named 
\family typewriter
<basename>XXX.com
\family default
, where 
\family typewriter
XXX
\family default
 ranges from 
\family typewriter
001
\family default
 to the total number of fragments.
 If you've chosen 
\emph on
Orca
\emph default
, the file name suffix will be 
\family typewriter
.inp
\family default
 and a number of other files ending with 
\family typewriter
.pos
\family default
 will be written to define the positions of the external point and surface
 charges.
 Input files for 
\emph on
deMon
\emph default
 also end with 
\family typewriter
.inp
\family default
, whereas those for 
\emph on
Q-Chem
\emph default
 end with 
\family typewriter
.in
\family default
.
 You may wish to modify the control headers of the input file to change
 the amount of requested memory or number of CPUs based on your available
 hardware.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sample commands to run with each of the programs is shown below for the
 first fragment of the 
\family typewriter
1d3z1
\family default
 system found in the 
\family typewriter
test/
\family default
 directory of the 
\emph on
afnmr
\emph default
 package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
g09 < 1d3z1001.com > 1d3z1001.log     # For Gaussian calculations, g03 or
 g16 also work
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
orca 1d3z1001.orcainp > 1d3z1001.out  # For Orca calculations
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Extracting chemical shifts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the QM calculations on all of the fragment input files, you will
 have a large number of output files whose chemical shielding tensors need
 to be extracted.
 Because we are modeling systems in solution, the molecules are free to
 tumble in every direction.
 As a result, we are only interested in the isotropic shielding at each
 nucleus.
 If only the shielding tensor is given in the output file, the isotropic
 shielding can be computed from the trace of the tensor.
 A reference shift (which is basis set-dependent) need then be subtracted
 to get the predicted chemical shift.
 Also, care must be taken to make sure that you extract only those chemical
 shifts from the nuclei primary QM region and not those in the immediate
 surroundingsâ€”those shifts are computed more rigorously in a different output
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Included in the SHIFTS package are a set of parsers written in Perl that
 will extract the relevant chemical shifts from each output file for 
\emph on
deMon
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Jaguar, ORCA
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Q-Chem
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
Gaussian
\emph default
 calculations.
 These parsers use the PQR files that were generated by AF-NMR to determine
 which nuclei reside in the primary QM region to determine which chemical
 shifts to extract from each output file.
 The script responsible for parsing the QM output file is 
\emph on
make-shiftsrdb
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
make-shiftsrdb
\emph default
 will try to parse all 
\family typewriter
<basename>XXX.out
\family default
 files where 
\family typewriter
XXX
\family default
 are any characters (typically numbers from 001 to the number of residues).
 If you used 
\emph on
Gaussian
\emph default
, the output file suffix 
\family typewriter
.log
\family default
 will be used instead.
 The output file will be printed in a simple tab-delimited text file that
 should be self-explanatory; it is also compatible with the RDB relational
 database format (see the description at 
\family typewriter
http://compbio.soe.ucsc.edu/rdb/
\family default
).

\begin_layout Subsection
Handling ligands or non-standard residues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
afnmr
\emph default
 code should be able to handle file that follow PDB standards that include
 proteins, RNA, DNA, water, and monatomic ions.
 If you have ligands, or non-standard amino acids or nucleotides, the procedure
 is more involved.
 Everything is based on the way that Amber handles these situations, so
 people familiar with Amber should understand what is being said below.
 (I am hoping to write instructions for more general users in the future.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-covalent ligands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have ligands that are not covalently bonded to the macromolecule,
 use the 
\emph on
antechamber
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
parmchk2
\emph default
 programs in AmberTools to create 
\emph on
off
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
frcmod
\emph default
 files for your ligand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Follow this tutorial: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "https://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial4b/index.php"
target "https://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial4b/index.php"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but use the 
\emph on
saveOff
\emph default
 command in 
\family typewriter
tleap
\family default
 to save an off file.
 Then use the 
\family typewriter
-offlib
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
-frcmod
\family default
 flags in afnmr to get these loaded.
 You can load files for more than one type of ligand, if needed.
 One current limitation: you need to put all ligand molecules after all
 protein or nucleic acid residues.
 (I plan to eliminate this requirement in future updates.) By default, 
\emph on
afnmr
\emph default
 will only compute shifts up to the last protein or nucleic acid residue,
 but you can get predicted shifts for ligands by including their residue
 numbers in the 
\family typewriter
-list
\family default
 option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Modified amino acids or nucleotides
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are currently a bit more compilcated.
 You can create the mol2 and frcmod files following this tutorial: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "https://ambermd.org/antechamber/pro4.html"
target "https://ambermd.org/antechamber/pro4.html"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 You then use the 
\family typewriter
-mol2
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
-frcmod
\family default
 flags to load these into afnmr, as with ligands.
 But then, you also need to edit the 
\emph on
afnmr.F90
\emph default
 file (in src/afnmr) to add the names of these residues to the 
\family typewriter
presn
\family default
 array (for proteins) or the 
\family typewriter
nresn
\family default
 array (for RNA and DNA).
 You will need to update the MAXPRES or MAXNRES variables if you add extra
 residue names to that list.
 Again, I am hoping to simplify and automate this process in future versions
 of the code.
