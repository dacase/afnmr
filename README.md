* Version history:
  * Version 1.0 is the initial split from the "shifts" code base
  * Version 1.1 makes it easier to use snapshots for solvated molecular 
       dynamics simulations as inputs.
  * Version 1.2 is the first to be hosted on github, and changes the 
       default basis to pcSseg-0.
  * Version 1.3 updates the way in which reference shieldings are estimated,
       using DFT calculations on reference compounds. 
  * Version 1.3.1 fixes the ways in which waters and ligands are handled.
  * Version 1.4 adds support for jaguar, plus other small tweaks
  * Version 1.5 provides for fixes for non-sequential residue numbers, adds
       tweaks for quantum geometry optimization
  * Version 1.6 fixes a bug in how the external charges were written for ORCA
  * Version 1.6.1 fixes a mistake in the documentation about the -mol2 flag;
       tweaks for handling extra points
