#  Notes
#  For use with fluorescent protein chromophores.
#  Tested with EGFP, EBFP, mCherry, ECFP, EYFP, and DsRed proteins
#  Intended for use with ff14SB, ff19SB and related force fields from the parm94 family. 
#  The chromophores are described using both gaff and parm94 atom types. The gaff parameters
#  are described by this file and the frcmod and lib files loaded below. The user must load
#  one of the above parm94-type force fields for those parameters.
#  For further details see publication:
#    K. L. Breyfogle; D. L. Blood; A. M. Rosnik; B. P. Krueger
#    Molecular dynamics parameters for the GFP chromophore and some of its analogues.
#    J. Phys. Chem. B, 2023, 127, 5772â€“5788.

# Add in gaff atom types that are needed to describe the chromophores.
